### Some information about myself:
-----------------------------------------------

I started my carrer as a manual QA engeneer 4 years ago. All this time I have been learning and developing in my field. But at the same time, I looked towards FE development. I was studying the code that needed to be tested and it encouraged me to go to this Stage 0 cource.

Last 2 years I have been working remotely and it helps me  to spend almost all my free time on self-study after working day.
I've found that I'd like to learn web development because this field provides possibilities for professional growth.

Actually I guess, that my current skills will help me in new area of IT and I will be able to get some new skills as Frontend developer.
